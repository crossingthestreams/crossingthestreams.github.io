There have been various discussions on the [Pulsar dev mailing list about plans
for future Pulsar
versions](https://lists.apache.org/thread/1bofpck07fgnv118s2z9qtpz7tvd8fg9). 

It's up to the Apache Pulsar community to decide what Pulsar 3.0 contains eventually. I understand that many might get confused about Pulsar 3.0 plans if that is called out before actual decisions are made. All future content in this blog post series will be decoupled from Pulsar 3.0 because of that reason.
